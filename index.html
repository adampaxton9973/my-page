			<h2>Talks</h2>
			<p>
			"Embeddedness of Timelike Maximal Surfaces in (1+2)-Minkowski space". Given at the 2020 Discussion Meeting on Zero Mean Curvature Surfaces (International Centre for Theoretical Sciences), this covers some ideas from my paper of the same name.	The slides for the talk are <a href="ZMC_discussion_meeting_slides.pdf"> here</a>.

			<h2>Publications</h2>
			<p><b><i>Embeddedness of timelike maximal surfaces in (1+2)-Minkowski space </b>(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08952">arXiv</a>, to appear in Annales Henri Poincar&eacute;)

			<h2>Notes</h2>
						<p>
							<b><i>Initial Value and Initial-boundary Value Problems for Timelike Maximal Surfaces in (1+2)-Minkowski Space </b>(<a href="dphil_thesis.pdf">pdf</a>): </i>
							<br>
						My PhD thesis, written at Oxford in 2019. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the field, Chapters 2-4 are results on the initial-value problem for TMSs, whilst Chapters 5 & 6 contain work on the initial-boundary value problem for TMSs. Chapter 7 discusses some interesting open problems in the field.

            <p><b><i>Scattering and blow-up for semi-linear wave equations </b>(<a href="waves.pdf">pdf</a>): </i>
						<br>
Written in summer 2016, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/luc.nguyen"> Luc Nguyen</a>, whilst trying to learn about wave equations. Mostly a compilation of quite well-known results on scattering vs finite-time singularity for semi-linear wave equations, but the presentation is unique and a few proofs & heuristics are my own. I hope it gives a good survey for anyone interested in the topic :) </p>

	    <p><b><i>Compactness results for flowing to a harmonic map </b>(<a href="harmonic_maps.pdf">pdf</a>):</i>
			<br>
Written in spring 2016, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/melanie.rupflin"> Melanie Rupflin</a>.  It gives a brief introduction to harmonic maps from surfaces, focussing on the phenomenon of "bubbling". There are some pretty pictures to illustrate bubbling, and we also proved a new compactness result for maps from degenerating Riemann surfaces, which is written up in Section 3. </p>

	    <p><b><i>Exotic Spheres </b>(<a
            href="exotic_spheres.pdf">pdf</a>):</i>
			<br>
My Masters thesis, written at UCL in 2014/15, under the supervision of <a href="http://jde27.uk/"> Jonny Evans</a>. The  goal was to give an exposition of John Milnor's famous construction of 7 dimensional "exotic spheres" (given in Section 4), and along the way we came up across a number of wonderful topics in differential topology such as fibre bundles, de Rham cohomology, cobordism, and characteristic classes.
