			<h2>Talks</h2>
			<p>
			Here is a talk about work from my DPhil thesis, on "Embeddedness of Timelike Maximal Surfaces in (1+2)-Minkowski space". It was given at the 2020 Discussion Meeting on Zero Mean Curvature Surfaces (International Centre for Theoretical Sciences).

	    <h2>My thesis</h2>
	    Here is my <a href="dphil_thesis.pdf"> DPhil thesis </a> on timelike maximal surfaces (TMSs) in Minkowski space. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the field, Chapters 2-4 are results on the initial-value problem for TMSs, whilst Chapters 5 & 6 contains work on the initial-boundary value problem for TMSs. In Chapter 7 I discuss some interesting open problems in the field.

	    <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p> Here are a few reports that I wrote during my graduate studies. I'm putting them up online in case they may be of use to someone :) </p>

            <p><a href="waves.pdf"> Scattering and blow-up for semi-linear wave equations </a>:
I wrote these notes in summer 2016, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/luc.nguyen"> Luc Nguyen</a>, whilst trying to learn about wave equations. Its mostly a compilation of quite well-known results on scattering vs finite-time singularity for semi-linear wave equations, but the presentation is unique and a few proofs & heuristics are my own. I hope it should serve as a good survey for anyone interested in the topic :) </p>

	    <p> <a href="harmonic_maps.pdf"> Compactness results for flowing to a harmonic map </a>:
I wrote this document on harmonic maps in spring 2016, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/melanie.rupflin"> Melanie Rupflin</a>.  It gives a brief introduction to harmonic maps from surfaces, focussing particularly on the phenomenon of "bubbling". There are some pretty pictures to illustrate bubbling, and we also proved a new compactness result for maps from degenerating Riemann surfaces, which is written up in Section 3. </p>

	    <p> <a
            href="exotic_spheres.pdf"> Exotic Spheres </a>:
This is my Masters thesis, which was written at UCL in 2014/15, under the supervision of <a href="http://jde27.uk/"> Jonny Evans</a>. The  goal was to give an exposition of John Milnor's famous construction of 7 dimensional "exotic spheres" (given in Section 4), and along the way we came up across a plenitude of wonderful topics in differential topology such as fibre bundles, de Rham cohomology, cobordism, and characteristic classes.

	The photo at the top of the page is a beautiful wild camping spot in South Wales. Drop me a line and I may be willing to share the secret location with you ;)
