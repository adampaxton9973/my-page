	    <h2>My papers</h2>
	    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08952">Embeddedness of timelike maximal surfaces in (1+2)-Minkowski space</a> (submitted) <p>

	    <h2>My thesis</h2>
	    Here is my <a href="dphil_thesis.pdf"> DPhil thesis </a> on timelike maximal surfaces (TMSs) in Minkowski space. Chapters 1 is an introduction to the field, Chapters 2 through 4 are results on the initial-value problem for TMSs (an extended version of my paper above), and Chapters 5 & 6 contains novel work on the initial-boundary value problem for TMSs. In Chapter 7 I discuss some interesting open problems in the field. 
	    
	    <h2>Some notes that I have written</h2>
            <p> Here are a few reports that I have written during my graduate studies. Now of course I see all kinds of ways they could have been written better. Nonetheless I'm putting them up online in case they may be of use to someone :) I also think it's nice to put these up as they tell a bit of a story about my development as a graduate student. </p>
        
            <p><a href="waves.pdf"> Scattering and blow-up for semi-linear wave equations </a>:
I wrote these notes in summer 2016, under the supervision of Luc Nguyen, whilst trying to learn about wave equations. Its mostly a compilation of quite well-known results on scattering vs blow-up for semi-linear wave equations. </p>

	    <p> <a href="harmonic_maps.pdf"> Compactness results for flowing to a harmonic map </a>:
I wrote this document on harmonic maps in spring 2016, under the supervision of Melanie Rupflin.  It gives a brief introduction to harmonic maps from surfaces, focussing particularly on the phenomenon of "bubbling". There are some pretty pictures to illustrate bubbling, and we also proved a new compactness result for maps from degenerating Riemann surfaces, which is written up in Section 3. </p>

            href="exotic_spheres.pdf"> Exotic Spheres </a>:   
This is my Masters thesis, which was written at UCL in 2014/15, under the supervision of Jonny Evans. The  goal was to give an exposition of John Milnor's famous construction of 7 dimensional "exotic spheres".
